# 1.0.2

Largely just porting data gen from the modpack to the mod itself.

- Added data gen for all item and block models that the mod needs.
- - Thus a lot of textures have moved over, attribution files aswell.
- Some item heats are done in datagen now.
- Added some missing tags.
- A few recipes are now generated (the rest are soon to come).
